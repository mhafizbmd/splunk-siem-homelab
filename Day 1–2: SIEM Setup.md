# Day 1‚Äì2 ‚Äì SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) Home Lab Setup

This Day 1‚Äì2 lab sets up a working Splunk Enterprise environment inside a VirtualBox-hosted Ubuntu Server. It simulates log ingestion and prepares a foundation for hands-on SOC analyst tasks.

---

## ‚úÖ Environment Setup

- Created a virtual machine using **Ubuntu Server 24.04 ISO** in VirtualBox.
- Installed **Splunk Enterprise** on the VM.
- Configured admin credentials using `user-seed.conf`.
- Logged into the **Splunk Web UI** from the host machine.

---

## üîÅ Port Forwarding Configuration

To enable smooth workflow and local web access:

- Forwarded host port `8000` to VM port `8000` (Splunk Web).
- Forwarded host port `2222` to VM port `22` (SSH).

**Allowed:**
- SSH access via PowerShell (for easier command input).
- Browser access to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to reach the Splunk UI.

---

## üîê Security Configuration

- Enabled **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** on Ubuntu VM.
- Allowed only the necessary ports:
  - `22/tcp` ‚Äì SSH  
  - `8000/tcp` ‚Äì Splunk Web UI  
- Verified firewall status and rule effectiveness.

---

## üì¶ Log Forwarding & Ingestion

- Created `inputs.conf` to monitor `/var/log/auth.log`.
- Restarted Splunk to apply the configuration.
- Simulated logs using the `logger` command.
  - Example: `Suspicious login attempt from 192.168.x.x`
- Verified ingestion inside **Splunk Web Search** using:
  ```spl
  index=* source="/var/log/auth.log"



```

### Splunk Web Interface ‚Äì Boot to Login Workflow
Displays the sequence from launching the Splunk Web interface after boot to a successful login.
This confirms:
- Splunk Web UI is accessible from the host browser.
- Port forwarding is working correctly (`127.0.0.1:8000`).
- Admin credentials were successfully used to log in.

### 3.Log Ingestion in Splunk UI

### Splunk Web Interface ‚Äì Successful Login & Log Ingestion Verified
This confirms:
- Test logs were successfully ingested into Splunk.
- Ingested events are searchable via the Splunk UI.
- Port forwarding is functioning as expected.
- The data pipeline from syslog (/var/log/auth.log) to the Splunk index is operational.
