Successfully completed the foundational setup of a Splunk Enterprise-based SIEM home lab using Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox. Key accomplishments include:

✅ Virtual Environment: Set up Ubuntu Server 24.04 VM with NAT networking and port forwarding for SSH and Splunk Web access.

✅ Splunk Installation: Installed Splunk Enterprise, configured admin credentials, and verified access via the web interface.

✅ Autostart Configuration: Enabled Splunk to start automatically on system boot.

✅ Firewall Hardening: Configured UFW to allow only essential ports (SSH and Splunk).

✅ Log Forwarding: Monitored system logs by configuring Splunk to ingest /var/log/auth.log.

✅ Log Simulation: Generated test events using logger to mimic suspicious activity such as failed logins.

✅ Log Verification: Validated that simulated events were successfully ingested and searchable in Splunk Web.

✅ SPL Exploration: Began using SPL (Search Processing Language) for basic querying and analysis.

✅ Documentation: Captured and organized setup progress with screenshots and uploaded to GitHub for public reference.
