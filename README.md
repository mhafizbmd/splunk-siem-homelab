## **Overview**

This lab is part of a 2025 cybersecurity learning roadmap. Over seven days, you will:

- Deploy Splunk Enterprise Free on Ubuntu 24.04 in VirtualBox  
- Ingest Linux logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/sudo.log`, `/var/log/syslog`)  
- Simulate SSH brute-force and other threat behaviors via `logger`  
- Build searches, alerts, dashboards, and correlation rules in Splunk  
- Document every step publicly (GitHub) to reinforce blue team skills and SOC workflows  

---

## **Tools & Technologies**

Splunk Enterprise Free (Standalone)
Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
VirtualBox (NAT + Port Forwarding)
UFW (Firewall)
Logger (for simulated logs)
SPL (Splunk’s Search Processing Language)
GitHub (for documentation & screenshots)


---

## **Lab Goals**

- Deploy and configure Splunk on Ubuntu  
- Ingest and visualize Linux system logs  
- Simulate adversary activity (e.g., SSH brute force)  
- Create and schedule SPL searches, alerts, and reports  
- Design dashboards to monitor threat indicators  
- Implement basic correlation rules for multi-vector detection  
- Perform simple Linux forensics searches (e.g., `/etc/passwd` changes, sudo abuse)  
- Publish all configurations, scripts, and findings to GitHub

## **Lab Setup Summary**
VM OS: Ubuntu Server 24.04
Hostname: splunk-server

Network: VirtualBox NAT with Port Forwarding
• Host 2222 → Guest 22 (SSH)
• Host 8000 → Guest 8000 (Splunk Web)

Installed:
• OpenSSH
• Splunk Enterprise Free

Firewall (UFW):
• Allow 22/tcp (SSH)
• Allow 8000/tcp (Splunk Web)

Access:
• SSH from host: ssh -p 2222 hafiz@localhost
• Splunk Web from host: http://localhost:8000

## **7-Day Plan (High-Level)**

- **Day 1–2: Environment Setup & Log Ingestion**  
  Spin up Ubuntu 24.04 VM, install Splunk, configure UFW, set up `inputs.conf` for `/var/log/auth.log`, and verify ingestion.

- **Day 3: SPL Fundamentals & Field Extraction**  
  Learn basic SPL searches (`stats`, `top`, `timechart`), apply `rex` to extract fields from `/var/log/auth.log`, and save sample searches.

- **Day 4: Alerts, Reports & Tagging**  
  Define scheduled searches and real-time alerts (e.g., failed SSH threshold), tag event types (`ssh_failed_login`), and document in GitHub.

- **Day 5: Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
  Create dashboards (trendlines, tables, single-value indicators) linked to saved searches (“SSH Attack Monitor”), and capture screenshots.

- **Day 6: Simulated Threats & Detection Logic**  
  Ingest `/var/log/sudo.log` and `/var/log/syslog`, simulate sudo abuse and service restarts, build correlation searches (e.g., SSH failures + sudo events), and tune with `tstats`.

- **Day 7: Wrap-Up, Final Report & Sharing**  
  Complete any remaining Splunk eLearning/BTL1 modules, write a final summary, organize GitHub subdirectories (`day1/` … `day7/`), and share results.

> Each “Day X” folder contains:
> - A `README.md` with detailed commands and explanations  
> - `/configs` for Splunk configuration files (e.g., `inputs.conf`, `tags.conf`)  
> - `/screenshots` for relevant images  
> - Any scripts or `.conf` snippets used
