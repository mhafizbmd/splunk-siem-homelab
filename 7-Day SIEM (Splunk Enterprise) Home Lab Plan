# 7-Day SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) Home Lab Plan

This home lab plan combines hands-on setup with structured learning from two key sources:
1. **Splunk eLearning (Search & Reporting + SIEM track)**  
2. **BTL1 Certification (Security Blue Team Level 1)**

The objective is to simulate log ingestion, event analysis, detection, and basic SOC operations using Splunk Enterprise installed on an Ubuntu Server VM.

This plan supports real-world analyst workflows while aligning directly with the SIEM-related topics covered in BTL1.

## Day 1–2 – Environment Setup & Log Ingestion (2 Days)

- Created a VM using Ubuntu Server 24.04 ISO in VirtualBox
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on the VM
- Configured Splunk admin credentials using `user-seed.conf`
- Enabled Splunk to start at boot with `enable boot-start`
- Verified Splunk was listening on port 8000

**Port Forwarding Setup:**

- Forwarded port 8000 → 8000 for Splunk Web access
- Forwarded port 2222 → 22 for SSH access to VM
- Verified Splunk Web UI reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` from host
- Verified SSH access from host using PowerShell

**Firewall Setup:**

- Installed and configured UFW on the VM
- Allowed only required ports: 22/tcp and 8000/tcp
- Verified UFW rules with `ufw status verbose`

**Log Forwarding & Ingestion:**

- Created `inputs.conf` to monitor `/var/log/auth.log`
- Restarted Splunk to apply changes
- Simulated logs using `logger`:
  - Example: `logger "Suspicious login attempt from 192.168.2.101"`
- Verified events ingested into Splunk using SPL:
  ```
  index=* source="/var/log/auth.log"
  ```

**Initial SPL Exploration:**

- Ran basic SPL searches via Splunk Web UI
- Used filters like:
  - `index=*`
  - `source="/var/log/auth.log"`
  - `sourcetype=syslog`
- Navigated the Search & Reporting app
- Viewed logs using table and timeline views

**Documentation:**

- Captured and organized screenshots of:
  - CLI: Splunk status, open ports, simulated logs
  - Splunk Web login, search results
  - UFW status and SSH access
  - Port forwarding table

## Day 3 – SPL Fundamentals and Field Extraction

- Continued Splunk eLearning course modules
- Referenced BTL1 material on log analysis and field visibility
- Used `fields`, `table`, and `sort` commands
- Applied `rex` and `regex` for field extraction
- Practiced `stats`, `top`, `rare`, `eval`, `dedup` for deeper analysis
- Saved SPL searches for repeated use
- Tested extraction patterns on `/var/log/auth.log`

---

## Day 4 – Alerts, Reports, and Tagging

- Created scheduled searches as reports
- Configured search alerts with different trigger conditions
- Practiced setting alert actions (email/log output/console)
- Tagged specific log patterns with event types
- Used `transaction` command to track multiple related events
- Documented alerts and tagging with screenshots

---

## Day 5 – Dashboard Design and Visualization

- Explored Dashboard Studio in Splunk
- Built dashboards with:
  - Time range selectors
  - Trendline charts
  - Tables with dynamic fields
  - Single-value indicators
- Linked panels to saved searches
- Customized dashboard layout and visual elements
- Took snapshots of dashboard builds

---

## Day 6 – Simulated Threats and Detection Logic

- Used `logger` to simulate attack-like behavior:
  - Multiple failed SSH attempts
  - SSH from unfamiliar IPs
- Built searches to identify:
  - Brute-force activity
  - Sudden logon spikes
- Tuned correlation searches for custom detections
- Used `tstats` for optimized performance queries
- Compared simulated events to real `/var/log/auth.log` behavior

---

## Day 7 – Wrap-Up, Final Report, and Sharing

- Completed remaining modules in Splunk eLearning and BTL1 SIEM content
- Wrote final reflection on skills learned and applied
- Organized GitHub folders:
  - `/configs`
  - `/screenshots`
  - `/docs`
- Updated `README.md` with project overview
- Uploaded screenshots and final Markdown summary
- Shared home lab results publicly (LinkedIn or portfolio)
- Reviewed use cases and considered ideas for expanding to cloud logs or multi-VM ingestion

---

## Notes:

- Lab conducted alongside:
  - Splunk Learning Course: https://education.splunk.com/
  - Security Blue Team BTL1 Certification

- VM and host communicate via VirtualBox NAT:
  - Port 2222 → 22 for SSH
  - Port 8000 → 8000 for Splunk Web access

- Simulated data is generated via `logger` in Ubuntu
- All key logs ingested from `/var/log/auth.log`
- Visual documentation placed under `/screenshots` in the GitHub repo
